            <h2>Semi permanent Eyebrows or Eyebrow Tattooing</h2>
            <P>Anyone who requires emphasis of the eyebrows will love this procedure and the time save never having to pencil again. 
            </p>
            <p>Once the procedure is completed you can swim, play sports or just lie in the sun without the worry of ever losing your brows. Choose between a soft textured look or hair simulation. If you have no brow hair or sparse brows due to over-plucking, then the difference balanced brows can make is amazing. 
            </p>
            <p>The procedure will also add delicate natural looking hair stokes to your existing natural brows which is particularly benefit clients with spares or non-existent eyebrows. You also have choices between soft texture look, hair simulation or a bold powdered look.
            </p>
            <h2>Difference between Microblading and Micro-pigmentation</h2>
       Microblading is a permanent makeup technique that falls under the guidelines of tattoo artistry. Eyebrow Embroidery and 3D Feather Hair Stroke methods are all applications of Microblading. Microblading is a relatively new, manual method of tattooing. It is considered to be semi-permanent, as compared to the traditional hairstroke techniques done with a machine. It is done using a very fine blade to deposit pigments into the dermis. Micropigmentation is permanent eyebrow tattooing or semi-permanent makeup method. This method is done with a digital machine. The colour is implanted deeper into the skin-known as the dermal layer. It lasts longer than Microblading or Eyebrow Embroidery method. Micropigmentation only needs to be re-touched every 2 to 5 years, sometimes longer. The skin does take slightly longer to heal being that is was done with a digital pen therefore the treated area needs aftercare ointment for approximately a week. The appointment time for this procedure is approximately 2 hours. This procedure lasts longer and costs more. Also, while Microblading focuses almost only on eyebrows Micro-pigmentation can be applied to other areas such as eyeliners, lips and scalp. Here at Skinskin we do Micro-pigmentation as it provides better results than Mircroblading.  

            <h2>Free consultation and patch testing</h2>
        <p>We provide free of charge no obligation consultation to address your questions and concerns. We will also discuss your request and assess face shape and colour. 
        </p>
        <p>A patch test 24 hours prior the treatment is essential. The patch test is a crucial routine procedure to ensure the client does not have an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic and hypo allergenic pigment. The test is offered free of charge and only take a few moments.
